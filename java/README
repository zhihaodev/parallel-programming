Compile the code:
	type "make"

Run the program:
	type "java CoinFlip 4 10000"
		or
	type "java BruteForceDES 4 16"

Clean executables:
	type "make clean"

Design:

CoinFlip:
Every thread has its private variable to count the number of heads. They have no shared variables and there is no critical sections. I sum up their numbers of heads after join() is called.
I use ThreadLocalRandom instead of Random to improve parallel efficiency.

BruteForceDES:
All threads have no shared state, variables, or objects. Each thread runs the same number of iterations during void run().
